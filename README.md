## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced my knowledge of **CSS Grid** and **responsive design**. Hereâ€™s an example of how I structured the grid:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  grid-template-areas:
    "create    social    social    schedule"
    "write     social    social    schedule"
    "write     manage    maintain  schedule"
    "growth    manage    maintain  optimize";
  gap: 10px;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to explore:

- **CSS animations** to add subtle effects to the UI.
- **Accessibility improvements** to ensure a better user experience.
- **JavaScript interactivity** for dynamic content loading.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - A great reference for CSS Grid.
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - Helpful discussions and feedback from other developers.
